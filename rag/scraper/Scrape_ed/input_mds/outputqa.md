## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4133203?comment=9528532
For 1.1, I am able to derive the equation of motion using Newtonian mechanics, but I'm confused as to how to do it via Lagrangian mechanics. With L = T - V,  I derive an expression for the kinetic and potential energies and then use the Euler-Lagrange equation, but this always results in an expression which only includes the force due to gravity. 

How should one go about ensuring the other quantities end up being included?

I would strongly recommend reading through discussion materials from 106A if you haven't yet, in particular discussion 8 dynamics. The solution for that worksheet as well as a walkthrough video are available, and they cover similar problems. They can be found here: https://ucb-ee106.github.io/eecs106a-fa23site/.

For 2.2 and 2.3, is it possible to force the limit to be 0 regardless of any conditions on lambda, breaking the desired conclusion, simply by setting x(0) = 0?
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4133203?comment=9644990
The question asks you to prove the answer for any initial condition 
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4133203?comment=9662342
For 4.1, can we assume any other conditions on u? If u is unrestricted it seems like the limit might not exist as delta t approaches zero, i.e. if u is Thomae's function.

Additionally, does the condition of Lipschitz continuity bound the change in f based on the norm of the change in [x, u], based on the change in x and u separately, or just one of them?
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4133203?comment=9671203
Good question - I believe for multivariable functions, the Lipschitz constant is the maximum of that for $x$ and $u$. This should answer your first question as well - $u$ must be continuous as well.

# Waitlist Priority
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4134748
I asked this in class, but just wanted to double check.

Do EECS/BioE students have waitlist priority over other non-EECS/BioE students on waitlist?

I'm currently #4 on the waitlist as an ME student and was curious if EECS student behind me on the waitlist would get in before me or not.
IK that's how it works for some of my ME classes. 

Thanks!

Hi! My name is Pranit and I'm a 4th year EECS major. I took 106a and my final project was a robot that could play tic tac toe. I specifically did the computer vision part where I extracted the board from the whiteboard and added checks for robustness (for example making sure to not extract a board state when the whiteboard is obstructed by an arm). I'm open to any project and am taking one other technical course this semester. If you are interested in working with me please email me at pranit@berkeley.edu or text me at 5103862741

# Waitlist Teammatching
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4138842
Should people on the waitlist try to team up with other waitlisted people? Like if one enrolled student is paired with another student who doesn't get into the class, would that pairing be detrimental to the enrolled student? (Although, if some waitlisted students get in and others don't, you could wind up with the same problem I guess.)
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4138842?answer=9552176
I think it depends on how long you're planning to stay on the waitlist, but I do think it's probably in enrolled students' favors to partner with another enrolled student. The waitlist will move somewhat, so in the end, it's up to you on how to balance that. 
# Question on Journal Club
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4139432
Hi, I am still confused on the journal club and the formal Lab.  Is the journal club a part of "1 hour of organized paper-reading time in lab sections." mentioned in the website policy, Or if that week has a formal Lab, and there will not be any journal club?

Are they mandatory and held weekly? Because I have a class end at 10:15 once every four weeks on Thursday, I want to know if I could be a little bit late for about 15 min once every four weeks at the journal club when I signing up for it. 

Thanks!


## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4139432?answer=9546891
Hi! Sorry about the confusion! The journal club is the 1 hour of organized paper-reading time. There's no other synchronous/in-person component of lab. Working on projects is done on your own time.

They are mandatory and they are held weekly.

As far as your conflict, I'd encourage you to choose a different section than the 10 am one, since coming late will not be great (defeats the entire purpose since it's only an hour-long meeting). Plus if you factor in the time it takes for you to walk from your class, you'd be missing half the meeting. On the other hand, since it's only every four weeks, it's probably okay -- you'd have to get it excused by whoever your Lab TA is, and make sure that you're not presenting on any of those days. But it's better for everyone if you prioritize a section you can always make it to, barring any extenuating circumstances.

Usually, it's posted to bCourses -- we're waiting to see if Course Capture will work for the past 2 lectures, but it may not be due to some technical issues. If not, we will do our best to get the slides up. However, it should be posted promptly starting the next lecture at the latest.

# Accessibility of class materials
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4162184
Why is it taking so long to have access to lectures and discussions? 
I was under the assumption that the class would be accessible to students who can not make it to class due to health reasons out of consideration for others. 
Other classes are able to post the lectures within hours after the lecture so the resources are there for this to be done. 
Should we not be considerate towards others and come to class even if we are sick because it appears that I am doing this at personal cost by falling behind already. 
## Response

I'm very sorry about that.

The first lecture unfortunately won't be available as a recording because of university issues. You should be ok though - it was background and logistics. You'll be ok if you watch the second lecture onwards.

Sorry about discussion - slipped my mind with some other things I was doing. Will release in the next couple hours.

I believe you are allowed to assume that there is no rotational component of the transformation (the gripper will always stay the same orientation), which significantly simplifies the math if you analyze it
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4177195?comment=9779020
We do not provide this and you would have to implement it on your own. Like Max said though you can assume there's no rotation.

One thing I found that I hope might be useful for others: 
It seems that some of the library functions like self._kin.inertia return np.matrix objects instead of np.array objects. These don't seem to follow certain conventions you might expect np.array objects to follow with respect to matrix multiplication dimensions and data type of elements of these arrays.

Also the project spec mentions that "We have found that gravity vector returned by KDL is quite wrong. So, we have implemented our own package to compute the gravity vector. This is the baxter pykdl package (which contains support for Baxter and Sawyer), and you should use this to access the robot’s inertia, gravity, and coriolis terms." 

Does the existing import phrase from sawyer_pykdl import sawyer_kinematics in follow_ar.py take the correct sawyer_pykdl in the baxter pykdl package, or do we need to import a different kinematics package? Thanks!

If your controller doesn't work first try the idea is that you're a bit methodical with how you go about diagnosing the issue and working to fix it. Experiments in this project can be as simple as just moving the AR tag around and seeing how it's performing

With respect to the theory section of the report, to what level do we need to "derive" the equations? Like for joint space PD controller, the equation is well known/shown in lecture. Do we need to derive this from scratch?

Does this apply to the other controllers as well? Would it work start with a high level description of the controller, then state the controller equations and explain each part of the equations for how it contributes to the overall system?

## Response

For the jointspace velocity controller, you can just set joint velocities. In step control, you can set target acceleration to zero

# DSP homework extension
## Question
**Role:** student

I just got my assignment deadline extension accommodation approved. It will be available in the DSP portal tomorrow. I will update the letter and send it again tomorrow with the new accommodation. Just curious if I can use it on homework 1 that is due tonight or do I use my slip days for it?
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4182979?answer=9644451
Hi Sandip, sure you can use it on assignment 1 (I'll add the extension tonight, but will expect to verify in the letter tomorrow). Here are the guidelines regarding the assignment deadline extension accommodation: 

Due to your DSP accommodations, you will be given a 2-day extension for each homework and project assignment. As a result, you will not need to rely on any slip days for that. Unfortunately, you won't be able to apply additional slip days on top of this 2-day extension since we aim to release solutions 2 days after the homework is due. If you need a longer project extension, we may be able to accommodate it if any circumstances arise, which will need to be communicated to us promptly. However, we encourage you to submit it sooner as otherwise, it can be easy to fall behind and project time will cut into the final project.

So, your homework deadlines will be on Fridays instead of Wednesdays. For example, tonight's homework 1 will be due on Friday (1/26). Your project deadlines will be on Sundays instead of Fridays, so Project 1 will be due on Sunday (2/4). I hope this clarifies how the assignment extensions will work for your DSP accommodation! Let me know if you have any questions.

While on the Policies - EECS C106B (ucb-ee106.github.io), it says There will be one midterm to ensure students are caught up with course material. It will be an in-person, synchronous exam on April 11th. Logistics will be released closer to the test date.

Personally, I hope it would be a take home exam.

Hi - yes, it was a take-home exam last year, but staff are discussing the possibility of making this an in-person exam versus a take-home exam due to alleged cases of academic dishonesty that occurred last year. If we do have an in-person/synchronous exam, it will be on April 11th. We will make a final decision on Monday, which will be released in the weekly announcements!

This is question 3.6. Is the shift from using the notation V(x) in the previous problem 3.5 equation 31 to V(t) in this section intentional? Does this mean we need to incorporate x(t) into our description of V?
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4197725?comment=9694527
Yes. Notice how the initial state is fixed in this problem. This means that we can simplify V(x, t) as V(t). The idea is all that really matters. I wouldn’t get too caught up in the notational nuances.
**User:** Max Wilcoxson
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4197725?comment=9697433
I thought that V was dependent on x and t, and that x also varied with time. Isn't this why when we calculate the derivative of V(x, t) with respect to the trajectory we need to sum the partial of V with respect to t and the partial of V with respect to x times the partial of x with respect to t (by chain rule)? (ie. x also depends on t, so fixed initial state doesn't allow us to treat x as a constant?) Thanks for the clarification!
**User:** Nima Rahmanian

These are great questions! Please keep asking away!



Everything you have said is correct. x is not a constant. However, in this question, since we have been given an initial condition, the value of x is implied by the value of t. For this reason, V only really needs to take the parameter t.



By writing V only as a function of t, it becomes more clear how to solve this problem. That is, it will help you find a function which upper bounds V(t).

Hi, I am a concurrent enrollment student that have not been assigned to any Journal Club. I was not added to ed at the time when the signup were done. If I understand it correctly, the Journal clubs are at the lab-times. Thursdays are the time that would work the best for me. Fridays are not ideal. Especially the last section on fridays would not work.

Hi Katherine. Sorry to hear that - I hope you feel better soon. I'll go ahead and give your group a 2-day extension. In the future though, you should use your slip days. You'll be able to apply 2 additional slip days on top of this extension, as well, but I'd discourage you from doing that because 1) you don't want to fall further behind for project 2, and 2) the other projects are much harder.

You can always do something like set up a Zoom and VS Code collaborative coding (that's what I did with my group when I got injured last year and couldn't walk to the lab). The only reason I'm suggesting doing this is if you start falling behind from the first project, it'll cause you to keep falling behind and ultimately cut into final project time.

Spend the time summarizing the key points paper (make sure you get to the relevant specifics). Emphasize how aspects of the paper connect to class concepts.

Most importantly: include a couple of discussion questions at the end. The way my partner and I made the presentation for journal club last year was by starting with each of the headings and allocating a couple of slides for each.

This was one of my presentations from last year for reference.

Hi, I have reached out to six different groups/people with the unresolved mark in the teammate matching thread several days ago, however, I don't think I have gotten any reply at all, and I know project 1 is due this Friday. What should I do in this situation as I assume "everyone" already has a group at this point?

If you can temporarily find a group of 3 to join as their fourth, please go ahead and do that, so that you don't fall behind in the course. It could also be a good idea to make a public post asking if anyone is still looking for a group at this point. 

Even if you can find one other person to work with, I think that would be a good start.

# Question on Discussion 2
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4248522
Hi, I had a question about the solution to part 4 problem 2 of discussion 2. In the definition of an energy like function v(X) that is locally positive definite is 1) that v(0,t) = 0 for all t and 2) v(x,t) is greater than or equal to a different function alpha based on the magnitude of x that is strictly increasing and continuous. In the solution I don't see where condition 2 is being met or why we are proving that v >= 0 since 0 is not a function that is strictly increasing and based on the magnitude of x. On an earlier example, we proved LPD by proving that v(x,t) was greater than a function e.v min * magnitude of x^2 but I don't see where this applies to this solution. Would someone be able to explain why we are using 0 as our alpha function here? Thank you!
## Response
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4248522?answer=9803620
I also thought that simply proving $V >= 0$ in a neighborhood was insufficient. But the claim is still true since you can use Taylor's theorem to get $$V(\theta, \dot{\theta})) = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\theta}^2 + a(\frac{1}{2} \theta^2 + O(\theta^4)) \geq \min(\frac{1}{2}, a) (\theta^2 + \dot{\theta}^2) + O(\theta)^4.$$ This implies the existence of some $\alpha$ locally.

**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4248522?answer=9845536
Ah yeah so I think I explained this but didn't write it down in the boardwork. The quadratic term will be larger than the linear term and therefore can be used as the alpha function.

# Possible extension of Lab1
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4254505
Dear Instructors:

Is it possible to slightly extend Lab 1? We feel that it is taking more time than we initially anticipated, and one week doesn't seem to be enough for us. Additionally, our team is still limited to only 2 members, and it appears that other teams are also facing challenges with the project. We are uncertain if a slight extension might be considered.

Thanks!

**Role:** admin

Hey everyone, sorry we were not able to extend the project. If you have extenuating circumstances as an individual or as a group, please let us know via a private post on Ed and we can extend the project on a case-by-case basis. Most groups were able to use slip days -- the future projects should be a little less tighter with the deadline and we will increase the allowed booking time to 3 hours rather than 2 hours.

# Problems on Programming in HW2 Problem4.3 - 4
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4260411
I use @ for the multiplication in calculating Vdot, but this error keeps coming.

ValueError: matmul: Input operand 0 does not have enough dimensions (has 0, gufunc core with signature (n?,k),(k,m?)->(n?,m?) requires 1)

And I traced back, finding this is because that the evaluation of Vdot is called by a function called (eval_force_vec) under controller. 

The function eval_LyapunovDerivs takes in argument (self,f,t), where f is input of the system.

and in eval_force_vec it is like this:

#set up optimization problem

 opti = ca.Opti()

 #set up optimization variables

 u = opti.variable(3, 1) #the input here is a force vector only! Will be 3D.

 #get the CLF value and its derivative

 V = self.lyapunov.evalLyapunov(t)

 VDot = self.lyapunov.evalLyapunovDerivs(u, t) #pass the input into the function



So, I found that it is passing a casadi variable u to evalLyapunovDerivs. And this variable is to be optimized to find the value, so it cannot be calculated by numpy expressions.

I wonder how should I deal with this problem?

Hey instructors. Our team was officially formed yesterday, which was the deadline for project1. The reason for this delay is that we were initially part of different teams, but most of members dropped the class as late as yesterday. Consequently, we have just come together and are essentially restarting the project. We have finished it now and plan to make our submission today.

In light of this unique situation, we would like to inquire whether we can be granted an exception to not use a slip day for this project.

For those with a MacBook looking to setup ROS on your laptop, I would recommend doing a 14 day free trial of Parallels Desktop.

Once you install Parallels desktop, then download and install Ubuntu 20.04 desktop x86 (if you have an Intel Mac) or Ubuntu 20.04 Server Arm (select ARMv8 build) (if you have an Apple Silicon Mac). 

Note that the Arm build is Ubuntu server, so after installing OS on VM you will need to install a desktop environment. 

Finally, follow the official installation instructions for ROS Noetic. 

You will also need to install packages listed in the project document. I also encountered a bug where /usr/bin/python does not exist, since Ubuntu now saves Python to /usr/bin/python3. You can install python-is-python3 to fix this. 

Hope this is helpful to someone!

Wanted to check -- for the point turn, we have to pass $\theta = 90^\circ$, so we will always hit the singularity for the sinusoidal planner?

Hey, super cool that you implemented that. However, it wouldn't be equitable for everyone who didn't know about this opportunity if you got extra credit for doing this, since we made it pretty clear that no sinusoidal stuff was necessary. But def explain what you did in your report! I'm sorry it took so much time!

What are the input limits for our sinusoid planner? In particular, the bounds for a1/a2 to our sinusoidal planner.

Right now, if we exceed the "recommended bounds", our sinusoidal planner works. Is this okay?

You should make sure your final matrix describing your differential equation is fully controlled by K. To do this, you can check to see if the characteristic polynomial is controlled by K.

Hi! 



  I was working on finishing HW2 tonight in MLK but ran and left my stuff except my laptop (including my phone, keys, etc.) at MLK when I saw the shooter a few meters nearby. I couldn't get my stuff back until now cause of proper procedure for the police, and MLK being closed. I just got my stuff back right now after a long night of not being able to go home due not having any keys and was wondering if I could get an extension on the homework as otherwise I would have no submission for the homework.

Q1.2: We state that the problem we are solving is a linear system. Are we able to assume the P Q R matrices are also diagonal matrices (in addition to positive semi-definite) because of this?

This is a cost written in quadratic form, so you should expect there to be quadratic terms. You do not need to assume the matrices are also diagonal. It might help to think about the properties of positive semi-definite matrices and how they can help you solve this problem.

For 2.5 it says we make the eigen value of Q that is multiplied by theta error equal to 0, because in this question we don't care about the orientation. It doesn't mention this in the context of the P matrix, but I just want to confirm that this is also the case for the P matrix?


## Response

It's not specified in the problem, but I agree with you that it would make sense to also make sense for the P matrix (defines the norm on the final error vector). This is because in the problem we generally don't care about the orientation of the robot as much as its position.

If I tell you that $x+y=0$, can you write out the value of $y$ using the other coordinates in the system, in this case $x$?

Use this same logic to write one of the generalized coordinates as a function of the other GCs and $h$. Then, differentiate.

I’m confused at the holonomic vs. nonholonomic intuitions. Shouldn’t the TurtleBot’s positions still be affected by the constraints since it can no longer go into certain areas? The only difference I’m thinking of is that it is not entirely constrained to a path in G.C. (much like a function h(q)), whereas the roller coaster has such an equality constrained upon it. 
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4335624?comment=10152574
Imagine you are in an empty room with your TurtleBot. Ask yourself this question without thinking about anything taught in 106B: could the TurtleBot's center of mass reach any location on the floor (or more formally, a two dimensional plane)? Moreover, could the TurtleBot reach any location on the floor in any heading?



Since the answer to these questions is yes, we know that the TurtleBot's kinematic constraints are not integrable. If they were, you would answer no to at least one of those questions. This is why the TurtleBot is a non-holonomic system.
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4335624?comment=10211278
I am really confused by number 1. I don't understand what the pfaffiant constraint has to do with the Lagrangian dynamics. And since all we know is that w(q)*q_dot = 0, and h(q) = 0, and we nothing about the functions w(q), or h(q), themselves, how are we supposed to isolate q_n double dot?


## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4335624?comment=10261645
This question is more about taking the algebraic equation h(q) = 0 and arriving at an expression for q_n ddot. Since h(q) = 0 is an algebraic constraint, we can find another function, say h_2(q1, ..., qn-1) such that h_2(q1, ..., qn-1) = qn. This process is essentially isolating one of the variables in your algebraic constraint. At this point, you can use h_2 to arrive at an expression for q_n ddot.



The system's Lagrangian dynamics provides us with a set of differential equations such that we can solve for q_1 to q_n-1 (this is given by the problem). This problem is stating that given the values these variables must take on, we can completely determine q_n ddot. At a high level, this means that q_n ddot "isn't special" -- it's determined by the rest of its buddies (q1, ..., qn-1). That is, we lose a degree of freedom. 
**User:** Noah Adhikari
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4335624?comment=10289819
I am struggling to understand this. How do you know that $h(q)$ is separable in $q_n$? For example, something like $h(q) = q_1 + q_1 q_2 + q_2 \sin(q_1 + q_2) = 0$. 

Then I don't think you can decouple $q_n$ from $q_0, \dots, q_{n-1}$, so there is no way to uniquely define $q_n$ in terms of $q_0, \dots, q_{n-1}$ and their time derivatives.

## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4398747?comment=10154644
I had two questions about HW1 grades:

In 2.2, why was it necessary that we explicitly accounted for imaginary eigenvalues? I simply stated that 

$$x_0e^{\lambda t}$$

converges to 0 for all x_0 if and only if lambda has a negative real part. This applies to complex eigenvalues as well, so there was no need to specifically handle imaginary eigenvalues.

In 4.1, while I understand how the solution brings us towards what we are trying to prove, how would compounding errors (i.e. error due to the fact that

$$\hat{x}(k)\ne x(k\Delta t)$$

) be handled? I assume that we would use smoothness to prove that these compounding errors go to zero as well. I find it plausible that it's true, I just think the proof given in the solutions is somewhat incomplete. The solution seems to just handwave this problem away by assuming that 

$$\hat{x}(k)=x(k\Delta t)$$

exactly, but this seems to be begging the question as we are trying to prove that the Euler estimate, xhat, is equal to the true value of x. Lastly, as brought up in a clarification during the original homework, I think this statement is only true when u(t) is also smooth, which also makes the solution feel handwavy as it appears to work regardless of the choice of u(t).

Please use the "request regrade" feature of Gradescope in the future for such questions for 2.2, since these always vary based on the submitted solution. I've left a comment on your assignment, and points were re-awarded.



For 4.1, the main point of the question is to get some intuitive understanding for why the Euler approximation is, in some sense, a "valid approximation". Any fully rigorous proof will have to be rigorous about what we mean by "convergence" (finite horizons, C^0 norm, C^1 norm, etc.), which can be done in a lot of ways, but all of which are outside of the mathematical skillset required for this course, so a wide variety of solutions that communicated a general understanding of why Euler works were accepted here.



For anyone interested, the following is a cute proof that also touches on the idea of convergence rates of approximation methods, and doesn't require a ton of background: na.numerical analysis - Conditions for convergence of Euler's method - MathOverflow

My group has been working on the sinusoid planner but we're seeing a very interesting behavior.

**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4400682
From my general understanding of motion primitives for RRT planners, motion primitives are small motions that span the feasible work space of the current robot configuration. And, we want to move along the motion primitive path for dt amount of time. For example, a set of motion primitives with velocities would be: 

This would mean that would need to use different inputs bounded by some range.

primitive_u1 = np.linspace(self.input_low_lims[0], self.input_high_lims[0], 5).tolist()
primitive_a2 = np.linspace(self.input_low_lims[1], self.input_high_lims[1], 3).tolist()
primitive_angles = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 5).tolist()
primitives = list(itertools.product(primitive_u1, primitive_a2, primitive_angles))


Where u1 would be the velocity input applied to x_dot, y_dot, and theta_dot and a2 would be the velocity applied to sinusoid steering model for phi_dot following the example from 1.5.2 The Local Planner from the lab doc. Ultimately, in the local plan function of configuration space class, I would traverse along the primitive path for dt amount of time from c1, and choose c_new that is closest to c2.

...
x, y, theta, phi = c1
v1 = np.array([np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta), np.tan(theta)/self.robot_length, 0])
v2 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])

best_plan, smallest_distance = None, np.Infinity
for primitive in primitives:
    u1, a2, angle = primitive
    phi_dot = a2 * np.cos(angle)
    new_v1 = v1 * u1 * dt
    new_v2 = v2 * phi_dot * dt
    new_c = c1 + new_v1 + new_v2
    distance = self.distance(new_c, c2)
    if distance < smallest_distance:
        smallest_distance = distance
        times = np.array([dt])
        positions = np.array([new_c])
        velocities = np.array([u1, a2])
        best_plan = Plan(times, positions, velocities, dt=dt)
return best_plan


If my intuition is correct, my question is what should be the size for times, positions, and velocities objects? As of right now, since we moved for such little amount of time, I assumed they should be of size one. I am also having trouble understanding what is ω in φ ̇ = a2 cos(ωt).  I ended up thinking that ω is just one of the inputs we needed to add, ωt ended up being theta, however φ ̇ is independent of time. Also for calculated distance between 2 configurations, I first compared the angles using diff = min (|θ1 − θ2|, 2π − |θ1 − θ2|) which is equation 5.7 from the Sampling-Based Motion Planning chapter. Then to calculate the distance, I used 

$$d\ =\ \sqrt{\left(x_1-x_2\right)^2+\left(y_1-y_2\right)^2+diff^2}$$

but I'm not sure if my intuition is correct for calculating distance involving angles.

Hi Michael! So in terms of the sizes, it's up to you (think about how long you want each "chunk" of planning to be). You can try out many different things and go with what works most optimally -- I'm happy to share what my group did when I implemented it if it's helpful! But just so you know it was not size one. In terms of the rest, generally, your intuition seems correct -- although it's a bit tricky to debug without seeing the behavior. I'm also happy to share what my group did in terms of primitives if that's helpful!

# Question about Dealing with Singularity
## Question

**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4435680
Hi!

I saw that in the project 2 release thread that one of the TA's says that we are not required to deal with singularities for this project. I'm running into a singularity problem with executing the point turn trajectory for the sinusoidal controller. I need to handle this singularity to actually run the trajectory, but from what the TA says, does it mean that it is ok for us to not handle this issue for this project? I am a bit confused about this. Thanks a lot!

Hi - if you're hitting a singularity and you're not able to fix it, what's important is that you can explain why you're hitting the singularity and explain how you would resolve the singularity in the report. You can try to fix it, but it is not required to implement/handle the singularity issue.

Hi Derek, I'm sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, lecture extra credit is the incentive for people to come, but feel free to watch back the recordings. Not getting the extra credit won't count against you in any way of course. There are other ways to get extra credit in this class in the meantime (through EPA, extra journal club presentation, etc). I really hope your leg heals soon!

I have a question about the wrench transformation. Take this figure from problem 2, for example. The reason we perform the transformation is to obtain the wrench in frame 0, which typically passes through the center of mass of the rigid body. Is this correct? If so, my confusion arises when considering that sometimes external torque might cause the rigid body to rotate about an axis that does not pass through the body's center of mass. In other words, the rotation axis might not intersect the center of mass. How do we handle such cases? 


## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4473405?comment=10418590
That's perfectly ok! The transformation takes care of that by combining the force and torque terms as needed to account for the shifted center of mass. Now, this may not result in a grasp that is in force closure, as you may end up dropping your object. However, the process of finding the spatial wrench stays the same.

I have a conceptual (kind of) question about problem 5. The question describes that we parameterize a set of 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates. What I'm curious about is how much information the 2D coordinates retain. 

My current understanding is that the 2D coordinates do not describe a path/coordinates on the 3D surface, but rather can be converted by the chart to find the 3D path/coordinates.

In part 4, we are asked to convert the path p(t) into a(t) = (u(t), v(t)). Does this mean to find u(t) and v(t) that we can then use to convert p(t) to p(u(t), v(t))?

Thank you in advance!

Yup, that's exactly right, you're trying to find $p(u(t), v(t))$. You should be able to find $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ based on the structure of $p(t)$.

Hi, that must've been a miscommunication. We introduced the concepts of the projects last week (making the deadline 4 weeks out), but we've been pretty consistently thinking both projects would be due the Friday before spring break. If we extend the project beyond spring break, we'll just have less time for the final project, which is worth a lot more of people's grades and not good for anyone involved. Both of these projects are a lot more approachable than the previous ones.

Should we expect a correct dead reckoning implementation to perfectly match the goal with zero error, or just be quite close? I feel like there should still potentially be some error due to the fact that the true trajectory is computed through integration of the dynamics, while we are still using a Euler discretization approximation, but I am not sure


Update: Empirically, there does seem to be a significant discretization error at dt = 0.1, but this goes away with dt = 0.01.

You should not expect it to perfectly match the goal with zero error for the drone or the turtlebot but it shouldnt be wildly off. Unless the data you are looking at for drone dead reckoning is the noisy data the final error should be noticeable but not egregious.

What's the purpose of this condition inside the update function for the turtlebot in the starter code?


if len(self.x_hat) > 0 and self.x_hat[-1][0] < self.x[-1][0]:

## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4503020?comment=10477424
self.x and self.x_hat are lists of states where the the 0th element of the state is the time in which that state occurred (note: this is not the same for the drone simulator as self.t will contain the appropriate time). So the first part of the condition is checking that we have an initial estimate and the second part of the condition is checking that the time of the most recent estimate is newer than the time of the most recent actual state.

I am having trouble getting extended Kalman filter to work, it seems like the sensor just doesn't provide very rich information, so the estimation seems plausible under the sensor readings, but compounding error leads the end result to be very different in location, even though sensors have similar values. How might one deal with this? Is this expected?

Edit: Turns out my parameters not correct, and I did not have sufficient variance on measurement noise.

Yeah, I realized this as I was going through - I thought we were supposed to recompute the entire trajectory using only x[0] (because the pseudocode algorithm has it in a while loop), but the update only performs one timestep which gets called by something else.

You can get quantitative measurements on estimation accuracy by just taking the average error between $\hat x$ and $x$ across all the timesteps. For per-step computation you can just print out the difference in time at the beginning and end of the call to update() for each method

I'm having a dependency issue trying to install vedo on my local virtual machine. I'm on Python3.8.10 with output:

There is no build wheel of VTK for python3.8, which is system python on Ubuntu 20.04. I would recommend creating a conda environment with a newer Python version, that resolves the issue

Edit: After turns out you actually need an older Python version. After a couple of hours of debugging, here is the sequence of actions that finally worked:
Create a Python 3.7 conda env: 
conda create --name proj4 python=3.7 (and activate it)

conda install -c conda-forge vtk==8.2.0 (install vtk version 8.2.0 through conda)

pip install vedo==2021.0.2 (use pip to install an older version of vedo that is compatible)

## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4503027?comment=10566803
If custom_grasp_planner already receives the contact vertices, doesn't that already define our gripper pose up to one degree of freedom? Do we just choose a value for that last degree of freedom to avoid collision with the mesh, or do we disregard the vertices passed in and pick our own grasp?

Also, as I understand it, compute_robust_force_closure would require the mesh to project the perturbed contact points back onto the mesh surface and find the corresponding normal vectors, but the function does not accept a mesh as an argument. Is this an oversight or am I misunderstanding how the method works?
## Response
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4503027?comment=10768398
I believe the starter code is pretty different from what you're supposed to do based on the "general workflow" portion of the spec (I guess it serves as an example assuming you already had the vertices). So I think you're supposed to modify the base code to run for a lot of trials and try a bunch of points on the given mesh, then find the best ones based on the three metrics.

Not sure about the angle of gripping though (maybe we just constrain it to straight down or straight out?)

For your second question I think you can add (default) arguments to the function if necessary.

There should be! 

So if you have a gripper on a Sawyer you can do 

from intera_interface import gripper as robot_gripper

gripper = robot_gripper.Gripper('right_gripper')


and then from there you should be able to call

gripper.close() and gripper.open()

**User:** Kaitlyn Lee
**Role:** student

Not confident about this, but I think b1 and b2 are like the beta terms from the grasping homework question 4.4 for the force closure constraint $v = \beta_1 v_1 + \beta_2 v_2$, where $\beta \geq 0$. It's pretty similar to the alpha terms from Section 1.1.

In contrast to what has been said with projects 3-4 being more straightforward, our group has found this project to be much more involved compared to the first three projects, and I think other groups are noticing this as well.

For example, the directions in the spec often conflict with the starter code, and the hints given do not fully explain the gaps, often leading to more confusion than clarification. There are mistakes and missing information in the code. There is little information on how to use cvxpy and trimesh (we are simply told to look up documentation), and while the theory doesn't look as bad as previous projects, we are left on our own to figure out a lot of things. Add on that we have to go from simulation to a Sawyer and this project is pretty gnarly.

There's nothing wrong with some mistakes and/or a difficult project. However, I am frustrated because the support has been quite underwhelming. There hasn't been a single staff response in this thread. I understand that the course is understaffed and that staff members are busy, but some of the comments here have gone unresolved for weeks, and it feels like students are being hung out to dry. It should not be students' responsibility to answer other student questions.

I don't have a proposal or anything to reduce the scope of the project, I would just like to see a bit more (Ed) communication from the staff going forward.

Hey Noah, your feedback is very felt and heard. This is part of why we extended this project further, and I'll be getting back to everyone on this thread + other Ed threads for this project ASAP. This project was definitely much harder to dev + support than I initially thought so it's great feedback for the future. Edited: we will also be grading the "real" portion of this project really gently. Mainly we just want you all to have the experience of trying out the grasping stuff IRL, but it doesn't have to work 100%. Will add this in during announcements today.

One idea that came up in project party today was that you could do the "real" part of the project without an AR tag. If you know the ideal contact point through the visualizations of the sim, then you could estimate a position to grasp an object using tf by directly positioning the gripper where it should be on the object. This is obviously not exact and not the most ideal, but will be accepted with full credit for the project given the time constraints. Edited: Just make sure you talk about exactly what you did in the report and why this might not be the most exact.

Shoutout to Hams for coming up with this idea!

Here are some notes we recorded while doing this project:

Pawn has inverted normals, nozzle does not. When getting the normals using trimesh, flip the normals for one object.
Both models are about 1.5x larger than the real objects. Scale down the location of the origin and the grasp position.
AR tag localization is extremely inaccurate - we first moved the camera closer to the AR tag to get a more accurate reading, then calculated the intersection between the known table plane and the line between the usb cam and the detected AR tag position. You can get the camera position using tf frame 'usb_cam'
The example images in the project spec images show z=0.091 for pawn origin but it's more like 0.064 (in the model, scaled by 2/3 for real)
The object origins are not aligned with anything significant; use Blender to inspect origin locations and axes orientation

Once we get the pose in the object's reference frame from custom_grasp_planner, how do convert in a way that it is in the robot's base frame? 

Also, we used lab 5 from last semester, and we are having issues with moving the robot arm. It can move to any position when the gripper is facing down; however, when we use the Cartesian coordinates and quaternions of the gripper from tf echo, it times out, basically outputting an error saying that the jointspace is empty. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!

What you’ll need to do is localize the object in some way relative to the robot’s base fram you can do this by using an ar tag or manually moving the gripper over the object and calling tf_echo. Note that the origins for the pawn and nozzle are not at the bottom of them so you’ll have to account for that

Hi Noah, that must've been a miscommunication. We introduced the concepts of the projects last week (making the deadline 4 weeks out), but we've been pretty consistently thinking both projects would be due the Friday before spring break. If we extend the project beyond spring break, we'll just have less time for the final project, which is worth a lot more of people's grades and not good for anyone involved. Both of these projects are a lot more approachable than the previous ones.

# Homework 3 Q3.1 Question
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4565292
I am struggling to understand the solution here. How do you know that $h(q)$ is separable in $q_n$? For example, something like $h(q) = q_1 + q_1 q_2 + q_2 \sin(q_1 + q_2) = 0$. 

Then I don't think you can decouple $q_n$ from $q_0, \dots, q_{n-1}$, so there is no way to uniquely define $q_n$ in terms of $q_0, \dots, q_{n-1}$ (and thus their time derivatives).

I didn't want to comment on the homework solutions thread since it isn't a megathread so it doesn't mark it as unresolved

Just made it a megathread!

You're right that it's not a true statement for Pfaffian systems in general. However, the question does say that you can assume the constraint can be made a function of $q_n$.

# Launch Issue with roslaunch proj3_pkg unicycle_bringup.launch on Personal Laptop
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4569616
Hey

I tried running the following on my dual-boot MacBook Pro (Intel i7, Ubuntu 20.04) without success, though it works fine on the lab computer:

roslaunch proj3_pkg unicycle_bringup.launch 
 estimator_type:=dead_reckoning 
 noise_injection:=true 
 freeze_bearing:=false


I get the error: 

[roslaunch][ERROR] 2024-03-14 15:28:57,908: OSError(8, Exec format error) [roslaunch][ERROR] 2024-03-14 15:28:57,908: RLException: Unable to launch [unicycle_node-2].
If it is a script, you may be missing a '#!' declaration at the top. [roslaunch][ERROR] 2024-03-14 15:28:57,909: Traceback (most recent call last): ...


I was able to run the simulation in project 2, which suggests it might not be a ROS setup error. I'm considering if it could be related to a potential computer architecture mismatch between the machine that compiled the unicycle_node file and mine. Both my machine and the lab machines are x86_64, but there might be other differences. Looking through the code, it looks like unicycle_node is a compiled Python file. Would it be possible to get that file and try to compile it myself?

Or does anyone have any other suggestions?

So sorry for the late response but we cannot give you the unicycle_node source file as that does contain the source code and would allow you to reverse engineer the solution. I am surprised that this is an issue though as I believe the original file was compiled with an intel machine running x86_64. If this has still caused issues with you guys working on the lab please do feel free to make a private Ed post and we can try to accommodate.

# Robust Force Closure Project 4
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4580163
Hi! Would we be able to get some more information on the Robust force closure metric method for Project 4? I and a few others are a little confused on how to proceed forward. I've been trying to figure this out for several days. https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4503027

# Hints for Project 4
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4592191?comment=10630259
Compute Robust Force Closure

Create a desired wrench similar to the above

You’ll have a certain number of trials (we have ~500). For each trial, get new normals and new vertices by sampling around the vertices (how would you implement this?), and compute the force closure. Record if it was a success. 

Why would we need to create a desired wrench if we can just call compute_force_closure() on our new normals and vertices?  If we can find that our grasp is in force closure given these new sets of vectors, shouldn't that mean we can resist the effects of gravity?
## Response
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4592191?comment=10630778
I also was unsure of why we would use the wrench function. I just sampled then called the force closure function to calculate the score. Additionally, how would we incorporate the torsional coefficient? I read through the textbook and resources and still don't quite understand.


**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4592191?comment=10789862
So, with robust force closure, the idea is to have a certain number of trials and for each trial, get a set of new_vertices and new_normals (you can implement the sample_around_vertices function for this, more on that below). If the new_vertices and new_normals returned by that function are usable, you can add to the total the result of the compute_force_closure function (in which you need to pass in a desired wrench). You'll return the total divided by the number of trials. The desired wrench isn't a separate function but simply the mass of the object times a 6x1 array that accounts for gravity. 

For sample around vertices, you can use np.random.normal and pass in some params to offset a new_vertices array that you can generate through find_grasp_vertices (a util function, you'll have to pass in the object mesh). You'll be able to generate some new_normal by applying normal_at_point (also in utils).

Not sure if any of that helped but please ask any follow-up questions!

What are A, b1, and b2 supposed to represent in contact_forces_exist?  My best guess currently is that b is analagous to alpha in the project spec, but I don't see why that would need a b1 and b2.
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4592191?comment=10801841
A is representing the discretized friction cone. So it would be something like

[[cos(i*2pi/num_facets)], [sin(i*2pi/num_facets)]] <- this should be a 2x1 matrix

and you're going to want to loop through num_facets (which is what i is), and basically horizontally stack all of these 2x1's to end up with a 2xnum_facets matrix. So think about going through and splitting the friction cone into two halves which is basically what A is.

And then b1 and b2 - the way that I think about it is like the weights that you're applying to get it to hold the constraints that we want it to in this situation. Those are mostly talked about in section 1.1, but I'll also add something in the hints about the constraints for contact_forces_exist as well soon!

If A is the discretized friction cone, then what is fc supposed to be?
**User:** Kirthi Kumar
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4592191?comment=10822220
Yeah so I guess when I said A is the discretized friction cone what I meant was it's the thing that applies the discretization (in section 1.1 it's what's referred to as F). We're using cvxpy to solve for the actual values of fc (in section 1.1 it's what's referred to as FC). And so b1 and b2 are the alphas that are referred to in section 1.1. Does that help?


**User:** Charles Paxson
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4592191?comment=10827124
That does help a lot, but I'm not sure I understand why there is a b1 and b2 vector, since alpha is just one vector.

Thanks for helping out.  I've been getting pretty confused because there are like three different notations in the resources we've been given.

for both methods mentioned above in project 4,, is it ok and/or expected that we don't use all of the arguments?

I understand that convolution is cross correlation (sliding the filter over the image) with a flipped filter across the x and y axes. However, I am a bit confused by the indexing. In 1.1, we take both indexes from [-N, N]. But the underlying F is a Numpy array with positive indices. Do we assume that (-N, -N) in the filter math notation corresponds to (0, 0) in the Numpy array?

Hello,

I am writing to request a one-day extension for the submission of project 4. Due to a critical equipment malfunction (a faulty gripper on Amir), I was unable to complete the video recording and final testing phases of my work.

I sincerely apologize for the late notice.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

I know we have to use custom_grasp_planner(object_mesh, vertices) on pick_place from lab 5 of 106a, but how do we get the object_mesh and vertices of the object to pass through the custom_grasp_planner? 
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4690805?answer=10876860
The objects are the pawn and nozzle which have the object meshes and vertices you need. You can then find the pose for an ideal grasp and you’ll have to transform this grasp pose from the object frame to the robot’s base frame. This can be done by placing an AR tag a known distance away from the object and finding the transform between the ar tag and the robot base. Alternatively you can also move the gripper right above the object and then do a manual translation between the gripper and center of object.

The poem you provided is a variation of the classic "Roses are red" poem structure. It's often used for light-hearted or humorous purposes. This particular poem seems to be a playful nod to the popular "Roses are red" format, incorporating a reference to "sim-to-real" and "106B crew," which suggests a more technical or niche context, possibly related to a specific group or community.

# Potential Extension for Proj-4
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4704244
Dear instructors:

    We almost finished the proj-4. But we feel like we might need 2-3 more hours to wrap up the report. There are a couple of trivial reasons. I personally attended my conference in last two weeks, which makes my two other teammates have a harder time. Also, there are some issues for Sawyer, and most of time, there will be a "time-out" bug so that robot will lose connection. We have to restarted the desktop. We contacted GSI but it seems no reasons was found. But even though, we almost finish it, just want 2-3 more hours! We have three slip days left. Although it is only allowed that 2 slip days can be applied for each project, can we still possibly make a special request for our case? 

Best

I was wondering if our group could possibly have an option for an extension on project 4, we haven't used any of our slip days yet so maybe could use some of the other 3 for it? We've been stuck on getting the simulation to work on getting the 4x4 pose custom_grasp_planner returns. We've tried using look_at_general (problem is that it's built for 1x3 matricies), get_gripper_pose (for some reason have a shape error) and making our own rotation and transform matrix which is inconsistent at returning valid poses.

How does this impact students with DSP assignment extension accommodations?
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4704576?comment=10867724
DSP students will have their usual allotted extension, plus as many slip days as they have left.

For example, say you have all 5 slip days left, then you could turn it in on Wednesday. However, you’re encouraged to turn it in sooner rather than later. 

Sorry I realize I miswrote last night and we're trying to get all Project 4s submitted by Monday to keep the class on track. Here's the true follow up:

We usually have DSP extensions as 2 days for every project (slip days don't come into play). Instead of the slip days situation, for this assignment, DSP students will be allowed to submit up to the full slip day deadline, so essentially you're welcome to submit by Monday (4/8) by 11:59pm. 

Regardless, as always with students with DSP accommodations, if you need further extensions please email me and I’m happy to talk further.

Hello,

One of the consistent errors we're getting for our project is: 

raise error.SolverError(
cvxpy.error.SolverError: Solver 'ECOS' failed. Try another solver, or solve with verbose=True for more information.


I was wondering how to solve this bug? It comes up after the first 5 images of pawn/nozzle shows up. The code that is giving the error is:

prb = cvx.Problem(cvx.Minimize(cvx.norm(G @ f - desired_wrench, 2)), constraints)
prb.solve()

## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4708998?answer=10908773
So sorry for the delay but the first 5 images are poses we give you that are supposed to be pretty good grasps. The reason why you're getting this error is because when you're trying to solve the optimization problem for contact_forces_exist() your optimization failed. This is likely due to an issue with how you've set up the system. Make sure to double check your constraints such that they aren't constraining the problem to be infeasible and that the function you're optimizing makes sense. feel free to comment with more questions!

With respect to the linearization plots, is fine as long as the x/y match the demo plot, right? Since there are no constraints on the other variables?

Hey we are stuck here. All turtlebots convert first and diverge finally (all go up or down). Do you have any suggestions?  Also znorm is so large finally (200+).  and phi will go from 0 to 30000 suddenly after 9 seconds.

Sorry if we're missing something, but on this part of the spec:

How do you know what $v$ is from $z$? $z$ only gives you the accelerations $\ddot{x}$ and $\ddot{y}$, and $v$ is the input velocity, but we need to know the value of $v$ in our flowchart to determine that. So it feels a bit circular and we don't know what to do.

You should be able to get these values from things like self.trajectory.get_state , self.observer.get_state , or self.observer.get_vel , or other similar methods.

I'd recommend looking at the starter code first because it outlines a lot of the implementation steps more in depth -- but lmk if you've got follow-up questions!

# Lab/HW Grading
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4731393
Now that we don't have a midterm and the grade breakdown percentages have been rearranged to account for that, I'm a little worried about surprise/unexpected grade changes.

Currently, we (at least I) only have grades for HW 1 and Project 1. I'm a little worried that all the remaining HW/project grades will come out all at once and my grade will suddenly change. When can we expect these grades to be released?

On a side note, I do believe holding back our grades since Jan 24 (when Project 1 was graded) is a little unfair as I have no idea how well I'm doing in the class and will have no chance to work to change my grade at this rate. I'm curious what other students think.

I completely understand where you're coming from on this - and would feel absolutely the same way as a student (and did tbh when I took it as a student - this class is understaffed even with the addition of extra staff from last year). We're doing our best to try to balance student support in the moment and grading at the same time. I'm working with all of staff to have many of the pending grades released over the next few weeks.

For what it's worth, the midterm grade percentage was redistributed equally into the other grading bins (other than journal club), so in the end I'd say your final grade likely isn't impacted too much by this change. However, I completely understand where you're coming from and we're trying our absolute best to make grades come out ASAP so that everyone has a better sense of how they're doing!

The students who are presenting should be on Zoom at minimum (so I can see it lol). It's fine if the presenters want to do Zoom from somewhere outside of the lab and as a result there's no guarantee that the presenters will be in the lab so I recommend all students join on Zoom. If you want to still come by the lab and see if the presenters are doing it in person as well which would be great!

# Final Project Hardware Questions
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4759105
My final project group came up with a few different project ideas but each one of them brings a few questions about hardware:

Idea 1: Modifying DexNet, testing on Sawyer: We are concerned the Sawyer will not be able to run our model. Is it possible to run the model on a separate computer and send the results to the Sawyer to execute? Are there any instructions on how to do this?

Idea 2: Grasping with multiple turtlebots: Are we allowed to use multiple turtlebots? Is it possible to control multiple turtlebots from a single script?

Idea 3: RC car with shifting mass to take tighter corners: Do we have any hardware or a hardware budget for constructing a small, fast, wheeled robot?
## Response
**Role:** admin
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4759105?answer=11017661
For idea 1: you can do the same thing as project 4 right where all you really the sawyer for is to execute a given pose/trajectory of poses. you can totally run all the computation for this on another computer and then tell moveit to execute these poses for you

Idea 2: controlling multiple turtlebots with one scripts is trickier. I would ask David Au since Im not familiar with how the networking is set up for that. As for using multiple turtlebots to be honest in the past students havent really used the turtlebot much for their final projs so I feel like you may be able to get up to 2 but this is going to have to depend on how many teams want them. 

Idea 3: I believe the hardware budget is $50 but all the ordering needs to go through David Au @Kirthi can you verify?

# Project 5 - Dimensions of z and w increase with multiple iterations (hardware only)

We receive the following error:

This happens after we run main.py to test our TurtlebotFBLin class. For some reason the method works for 1-3 iterations, and then errors with the above message. We have confirmed that self._u consists of only floats. We would appreciate any pointers as to finding what we should fix.

We also noticed that as iterations ran, our variables would have an additional set of brackets around them, indicating that another dimension is added. We do not know where this happens.

z [1.83292967e-09 3.29448337e-08]

It might be because you're getting a type issue. This could be because of a dimension mismatch -- I notice your z and _u have different dimensions as the output continues. Double check to make sure your dimensions are consistent across the board -- it's a bit trickier to pinpoint this issue exactly without having the full scope of your code.

Hey! So the way we graded it, this will be taken into account when grades are finalized on our end. So your score will be adjusted for it to be extra credit. Mostly because gradescope doesn't have a way for something to be out of zero (or if it does, I wasn't able to figure it out).

# Final Project Casadi invalid number detected
## Question
**Role:** student
**URL:** https://edstem.org/us/courses/54072/discussion/4832097
I am running an optimizer for my final project using Casadi like we did on proj2, but using the dynamics and constraints for my situation. However, I get an error saying invalid number detected solver failed. Does anyone know how to fix this or what is causing the problem?

This is Ipopt version 3.14.11, running with linear solver MUMPS 5.4.1.

I am not necessarily sure without additional information or looking at your code. However, I asked GPT 4 for some potential areas to check, and this is what it said. Have you checked these? Might be helpful:

The error message you're encountering, "Invalid number in NLP function or derivative detected", typically indicates that there are NaN (Not a Number) or Inf (Infinity) values being produced during the evaluation of your optimization problem. This can happen due to several reasons related to the formulation of your problem or the numerical properties of the solver and model. Here are some steps and checks you can perform to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve this issue:

Initial Values: The error messages suggest that there's a NaN detected at a specific point during the Jacobian evaluation. Check your initial values to ensure they are feasible and within a reasonable range. NaN or Inf values can occur if the initial values lead to undefined operations (like division by zero).

Scaling of Variables: Sometimes, very large or very small values of variables or parameters can lead to numerical instability in solvers like Ipopt. Make sure your variables are scaled properly. This means that typical values used in calculations should be close to 1 if possible.

Bounds and Constraints: Review the bounds on your variables and the constraints in your model. Ensure that all constraints are correctly implemented and that there are no contradictions or impossible conditions. An unbounded variable or poorly defined constraint can lead to extreme values that result in numerical errors.

Derivatives and Jacobians: Since the error specifically mentions the Jacobian of equality and inequality constraints, make sure that these derivatives are correctly defined. If you are providing analytical derivatives, verify their correctness. Alternatively, consider using automatic differentiation if supported by CasADi, to avoid manual errors.

Solver Settings: Adjusting solver settings can sometimes help manage numerical difficulties. You can try changing parameters related to step size, tolerance, or even switching between exact and approximate derivative calculations in the Ipopt settings.

Model Simplification: Temporarily simplify your model by reducing the number of variables or constraints, or by solving a simplified version of the problem. This can help isolate the source of the numerical issues.

Use opti.debug.value: As suggested in the error message, use the opti.debug.value method to inspect the values of variables at the point where the solver fails. This can give you insight into which variables or constraints are causing the problem.

Check CasADi and Ipopt versions: Ensure that your versions of CasADi and Ipopt are compatible and that you are using versions without known bugs that might affect your problem.

Here's a brief example of how you might use opti.debug.value to inspect the problematic values:

# Assuming `opti` is your CasADi Opti instance
try:
    sol = opti.solve()
except Exception as e:
    print("Solver failed:", str(e))
    # Print debug information for all variables

# Possible Homework Drop or Revision?
## Question

Hi! I was wondering if course staff will be willing to consider allowing a homework drop or revising our past homework for credit similar to EECS16b or alternatively, assigning homework 6 as extra credit in the homework category? Since we also did not have a midterm and only had five homework assignments, if we got a low score on one of the homework assignments it would impact our grade quite a bit. No worries if not, thank you!
