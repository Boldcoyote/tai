My assumption is that ME is lower priority as I'm still #4 but the waitlist has gone down by 3 (assuming students didn't leave the waitlist)

I asked this in class, but just wanted to double check.

Do EECS/BioE students have waitlist priority over other non-EECS/BioE students on waitlist?

I'm currently #4 on the waitlist as an ME student and was curious if EECS student behind me on the waitlist would get in before me or not.
IK that's how it works for some of my ME classes. 

Thanks!

Hi everyone! My name is Alejandro and I am a 4th year EECS major. I don't have a group yet for labs or projects so I am open to start one with anyone :) I try to get started early on big assignments and I am aiming for an A in this course so I am looking for people with similar goals.

Hey. Thanks instructors for organizing this. I am 3rd year EECS PhD working on speech and active interaction. I also took 106/206A last fall semester. I plan to take this course almost 100%. My only concern is that I might not have too much time solving all homeworks due to my other research load. But I will try my best. In the meantime, I am looking for lab/project mates. Welcome to pin me at jiachenlian@berkeley.edu

Hi! My name is Pranit and I'm a 4th year EECS major. I took 106a and my final project was a robot that could play tic tac toe. I specifically did the computer vision part where I extracted the board from the whiteboard and added checks for robustness (for example making sure to not extract a board state when the whiteboard is obstructed by an arm). I'm open to any project and am taking one other technical course this semester. If you are interested in working with me please email me at pranit@berkeley.edu or text me at 5103862741

Since it is the same quiz as 106a/206a, can the quiz be switched to autograder so we know if we passed the quiz or not? Thanks

I would still like to stay in this journal club time, as I'll be able to schedule around it in the future now that it has been assigned. I'll make sure to catch up with my lab partner on the details that I miss. Thank you!

We think it might be a good idea to update / reinstall matplotlib on Amir's computer because there seems to be a circular dependency with matplotlib itself. We run into an OSError when we try it ourselves so we might not have permissions.

Are we allowed to restrict the velocity to a certain range for safety reasons? We experienced a velocity spike which caused really unstable behaviour by the robot.
**User:** James Ni

To clarify, the velocity spike is in the desired velocity, which is unexpected because the position graphs are smooth and look like what we expect. Attached is a picture of our workspace error.

One thing I found that I hope might be useful for others: 
It seems that some of the library functions like self._kin.inertia return np.matrix objects instead of np.array objects. These don't seem to follow certain conventions you might expect np.array objects to follow with respect to matrix multiplication dimensions and data type of elements of these arrays.

Since a difficulties section was not outlined in the deliverables within the project spec, I was not aware it existed until just now, when submitting my team's report to Gradescope. However, we elaborate on difficulties encountered when going over our tuning process in the experimental results section - would it be sufficient to match those pages for the difficulties question on Gradescope?

Thanks. I understand. Not sure about the projects though since I will be working with 2 other students. It’s ok if I submit for the team and they won’t get penalized for it. Essentially I am asking if my extension will apply to my team for the projects. 
Also the DSP system is still processing the update I’ll use the slip days on this one. If it does not get processed soon then I will try to generate a pdf and email it.

Hey Sandip, no worries I already added the extension to Gradescope so don't worry about it. And yes, your project partners won't be penalized for submitting 2 days late. You won't even have to submit for the team, the extension will just be applied to your group. Hope that clarifies it!

The solutions are not being released 2 days after the homework due date and normally in other classes they give 3 days extension and I think I need that extra day because I have been able to compete the homework’s so far with the time given. Especially because I have to do a lot of self learning since I do not find the lectures useful for my learning style.

I just got my assignment deadline extension accommodation approved. It will be available in the DSP portal tomorrow. I will update the letter and send it again tomorrow with the new accommodation. Just curious if I can use it on homework 1 that is due tonight or do I use my slip days for it?

Are we supposed to tune gamma based on the animation? I put in a value to start with, got the animation, and noticed that the drone hovers/circles around the target pos a bit before aligning properly. Can we perhaps get a ball park range of what value to test (i.e what order of 10?)

Hi, I am a concurrent enrollment student that have not been assigned to any Journal Club. I was not added to ed at the time when the signup were done. If I understand it correctly, the Journal clubs are at the lab-times. Thursdays are the time that would work the best for me. Fridays are not ideal. Especially the last section on fridays would not work.



I am sorry that I am a bit late. As a concurrent enrollment student, putting together my schedule have been surprisingly difficult. Hope this won't impact my results / grade. I am motivated to do a very high effort from this point on.



Thank you!

Hi! I’m so sorry but I just tested positive for Covid and I’m the only member of our lab group who took 106A and has experience with using and debugging the Sawyer robots. Would it be possible for our group to get an extension on the project if needed? so far we’ve completed the setup for the lab but I’m worried my group would have trouble debugging since I can’t be there in person.

Hi, 

We are having trouble running Project 1, It is giving us an error stating how it cannot import ImageTK from PIL when running main.py. We tried moving computers, pip installing PIL, we are stuck and don't know how to continue. We talked to Michael during OH and he suggest moving computers but it seems that we still keep running into this problem. Thank you.

I believe I am correctly calculating the torque based on this comment about the output coriolis matrix and the given formula in the textbook/docstring, but when running my torque controller on line trajectory (line trajectory has been tested with another controller) the robot moves down and turn?s the wrist (such that it faces toward the computer).

Is there any way I can work on this initial project alone? I've been asking around and haven't found anyone to work on it with (one person didn't plan on working on it because they were busy, and the other was dropping the course). I can keep looking in the meantime, though.

I also thought that simply proving $V >= 0$ in a neighborhood was insufficient. But the claim is still true since you can use Taylor's theorem to get $$V(\theta, \dot{\theta})) = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\theta}^2 + a(\frac{1}{2} \theta^2 + O(\theta^4)) \geq \min(\frac{1}{2}, a) (\theta^2 + \dot{\theta}^2) + O(\theta)^4.$$ This implies the existence of some $\alpha$ locally.

Hey. We already formed a team of three. However, we feel like one member of our team has zero experience for this course. For example, he does not know python, github, ros, and everything.

Hey instructors. Our team was officially formed yesterday, which was the deadline for project1. The reason for this delay is that we were initially part of different teams, but most of members dropped the class as late as yesterday. Consequently, we have just come together and are essentially restarting the project. We have finished it now and plan to make our submission today.

In light of this unique situation, we would like to inquire whether we can be granted an exception to not use a slip day for this project.

After doing a bunch of stuff I got a P matrix that contains K, tho not sure what to do from here, admittedly don’t wanna do the work of finding E.Val’s for a 4x4 matrix if not necessary 😅 got a tip about splitting the 4x4 into 4 2x2 matrices tho not sure how relevant that is. Or if I’m done, not sure how I showed v = -Kz was valid (unless it valid due to being able to insert it into P?

Hi! 



  I was working on finishing HW2 tonight in MLK but ran and left my stuff except my laptop (including my phone, keys, etc.) at MLK when I saw the shooter a few meters nearby. I couldn't get my stuff back until now cause of proper procedure for the police, and MLK being closed. I just got my stuff back right now after a long night of not being able to go home due not having any keys and was wondering if I could get an extension on the homework as otherwise I would have no submission for the homework. I can provide screenshots collaborating this from my work slack including some poorly aged messages

In a lab worksession a partner reminded that this was not the case, and I am wondering if I will be docked points or if I could make this assignment up somehow?

I am struggling to understand this. How do you know that $h(q)$ is separable in $q_n$? For example, something like $h(q) = q_1 + q_1 q_2 + q_2 \sin(q_1 + q_2) = 0$. 

Then I don't think you can decouple $q_n$ from $q_0, \dots, q_{n-1}$, so there is no way to uniquely define $q_n$ in terms of $q_0, \dots, q_{n-1}$ and their time derivatives.

I had two questions about HW1 grades:

In 2.2, why was it necessary that we explicitly accounted for imaginary eigenvalues? I simply stated that 

$$x_0e^{\lambda t}$$

converges to 0 for all x_0 if and only if lambda has a negative real part. This applies to complex eigenvalues as well, so there was no need to specifically handle imaginary eigenvalues.

In 4.1, while I understand how the solution brings us towards what we are trying to prove, how would compounding errors (i.e. error due to the fact that

$$\hat{x}(k)\ne x(k\Delta t)$$

) be handled? I assume that we would use smoothness to prove that these compounding errors go to zero as well. I find it plausible that it's true, I just think the proof given in the solutions is somewhat incomplete. The solution seems to just handwave this problem away by assuming that 

$$\hat{x}(k)=x(k\Delta t)$$

exactly, but this seems to be begging the question as we are trying to prove that the Euler estimate, xhat, is equal to the true value of x. Lastly, as brought up in a clarification during the original homework, I think this statement is only true when u(t) is also smooth, which also makes the solution feel handwavy as it appears to work regardless of the choice of u(t).

Please use the "request regrade" feature of Gradescope in the future for such questions for 2.2, since these always vary based on the submitted solution. I've left a comment on your assignment, and points were re-awarded.



For 4.1, the main point of the question is to get some intuitive understanding for why the Euler approximation is, in some sense, a "valid approximation". Any fully rigorous proof will have to be rigorous about what we mean by "convergence" (finite horizons, C^0 norm, C^1 norm, etc.), which can be done in a lot of ways, but all of which are outside of the mathematical skillset required for this course, so a wide variety of solutions that communicated a general understanding of why Euler works were accepted here.



For anyone interested, the following is a cute proof that also touches on the idea of convergence rates of approximation methods, and doesn't require a ton of background: na.numerical analysis - Conditions for convergence of Euler's method - MathOverflow

My group has been working on the sinusoid planner but we're seeing a very interesting behavior. This is the planned path, but when it is executed, the actual trajectory it takes is the one drawn in red. Is there any part of our code for the planner that looks off? We're thinking it might be an issue with the steer_y, and have already caught a few issues with it. Is there some factor of 2 we're missing?

We've been stuck on this for a while, and we're not getting anywhere. The following is our latest code for the local planner function.

        def get_plans(current_pos, t, current_plan = None):
            nonlocal plans

            # Dynamics
            theta = current_pos[0]
            v1 = np.array([np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta), np.tan(theta)/self.robot_length, 0])
            v2 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1]) 

            for primitive in self.primitives:
                u1, u2 = primitive
                velocity = u1 * v1 + u2 * v2
                new_position = current_pos + velocity * dt
                root_plan = copy.deepcopy(current_plan) # Make copy of root plan to make new paths for each primitive

                # If the new position and primitive violates the contraints, do not build on top of this plan
                if self.check_constraints(new_position, primitive):
                    plans += [current_plan]
                    continue
                
                # Parameters for plan object
                times = np.array([0, dt]) # At time 0
                positions = np.array([current_pos, new_position]) # We're at current position
                inputs = np.array([u1, u2]) # We apply these primitives to obtain new position

From my general understanding of motion primitives for RRT planners, motion primitives are small motions that span the feasible work space of the current robot configuration. And, we want to move along the motion primitive path for dt amount of time. For example, a set of motion primitives with velocities would be: 

This would mean that would need to use different inputs bounded by some range.

primitive_u1 = np.linspace(self.input_low_lims[0], self.input_high_lims[0], 5).tolist()
primitive_a2 = np.linspace(self.input_low_lims[1], self.input_high_lims[1], 3).tolist()
primitive_angles = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 5).tolist()
primitives = list(itertools.product(primitive_u1, primitive_a2, primitive_angles))


Where u1 would be the velocity input applied to x_dot, y_dot, and theta_dot and a2 would be the velocity applied to sinusoid steering model for phi_dot following the example from 1.5.2 The Local Planner from the lab doc. Ultimately, in the local plan function of configuration space class, I would traverse along the primitive path for dt amount of time from c1, and choose c_new that is closest to c2.

...
x, y, theta, phi = c1
v1 = np.array([np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta), np.tan(theta)/self.robot_length, 0])
v2 = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])

best_plan, smallest_distance = None, np.Infinity
for primitive in primitives:
    u1, a2, angle = primitive
    phi_dot = a2 * np.cos(angle)
    new_v1 = v1 * u1 * dt
    new_v2 = v2 * phi_dot * dt
    new_c = c1 + new_v1 + new_v2
    distance = self.distance(new_c, c2)
    if distance < smallest_distance:
        smallest_distance = distance
        times = np.array([dt])
        positions = np.array([new_c])
        velocities = np.array([u1, a2])
        best_plan = Plan(times, positions, velocities, dt=dt)
return best_plan


If my intuition is correct, my question is what should be the size for times, positions, and velocities objects? As of right now, since we moved for such little amount of time, I assumed they should be of size one. I am also having trouble understanding what is ω in φ ̇ = a2 cos(ωt).  I ended up thinking that ω is just one of the inputs we needed to add, ωt ended up being theta, however φ ̇ is independent of time. Also for calculated distance between 2 configurations, I first compared the angles using diff = min (|θ1 − θ2|, 2π − |θ1 − θ2|) which is equation 5.7 from the Sampling-Based Motion Planning chapter. Then to calculate the distance, I used 

$$d\ =\ \sqrt{\left(x_1-x_2\right)^2+\left(y_1-y_2\right)^2+diff^2}$$

but I'm not sure if my intuition is correct for calculating distance involving angles.

Yeah, I realized this as I was going through - I thought we were supposed to recompute the entire trajectory using only x[0] (because the pseudocode algorithm has it in a while loop), but the update only performs one timestep which gets called by something else.

Try opening model file in Blender (installed on lab machines). Then you can see origin. It seems a bit random, so I’d recommend using Blender to visualize it and measure distances to sides of object.

Compute Robust Force Closure

Create a desired wrench similar to the above

You’ll have a certain number of trials (we have ~500). For each trial, get new normals and new vertices by sampling around the vertices (how would you implement this?), and compute the force closure. Record if it was a success. 

Why would we need to create a desired wrench if we can just call compute_force_closure() on our new normals and vertices?  If we can find that our grasp is in force closure given these new sets of vectors, shouldn't that mean we can resist the effects of gravity?
**User:** Cecilia Pham

I also was unsure of why we would use the wrench function. I just sampled then called the force closure function to calculate the score. Additionally, how would we incorporate the torsional coefficient? I read through the textbook and resources and still don't quite understand.


**User:** Kirthi Kumar
**Role:** admin

So, with robust force closure, the idea is to have a certain number of trials and for each trial, get a set of new_vertices and new_normals (you can implement the sample_around_vertices function for this, more on that below). If the new_vertices and new_normals returned by that function are usable, you can add to the total the result of the compute_force_closure function (in which you need to pass in a desired wrench). You'll return the total divided by the number of trials. The desired wrench isn't a separate function but simply the mass of the object times a 6x1 array that accounts for gravity. 

For sample around vertices, you can use np.random.normal and pass in some params to offset a new_vertices array that you can generate through find_grasp_vertices (a util function, you'll have to pass in the object mesh). You'll be able to generate some new_normal by applying normal_at_point (also in utils).

Not sure if any of that helped but please ask any follow-up questions!

for both methods mentioned above in project 4,, is it ok and/or expected that we don't use all of the arguments? Looked at pages surrounding 219 for, get grasp map and don't know where I would involve friction or num_facets. compute force closure doesn't use num_facets (we think we can hardcode to just be 2, or object mass. Also wanted to ask if the code we have seems reasonable for the two methods (picture below)

Hi Course Staff,

I have completed project 3 but I have a few images and files on the lab computers that I need to finish my report. I should have been in Berkeley today to gather the files and submit the report but my flight got canceled today and the soonest flight they could put me on was early Wednesday morning. I was wondering if I could get a one-day extension. I realize that the announcement of the project said it was a hard deadline but under the circumstances, I am not really sure what else I can do.

Thanks,

I don't want other people (aka course staff) to see my tax documents and I don't think I can delete the submission as a student. I would greatly appreciate if someone on course staff could delete the submission for me. Thanks.

Info: My first submission in Gradescope assignment for project 4 report

I'm trying to use multithreading to calculate the grasp data, and then save it to a file so I don't have to recalculate every time. I keep getting this exception. Is this a cause for concern? Also, even though I ensure that my threads write to different locations, and that there are only 2 active at any given time, I keep getting segfaults. I'm confused but I don't want to give up on this
Edit: Added a picture of where I am threading.

Just wanted to clarify, does my group need to do anything additional so we aren't marked late? We submitted Friday night, as per our extra 1 day beyond our 5 slip days,

Hello,

Would it be possible for our group to get a 1-2 day extension on project 4? we used our last slip day today but we had a lot of inexplicable bugs (like utils.py not working??) and with limited time with sawyers, it seems impossible to finish in the next 5 hours. Also, one of our group members  (me) had to unexpectedly go to the health centre for a few hours yesterday which didn't help our progress...

It would be greatly appreciated if we could be granted a bit more type to deliver our best work (and preferably work under a bit less stress).

Thank you!

Dear instructors:

    We almost finished the proj-4. But we feel like we might need 2-3 more hours to wrap up the report. There are a couple of trivial reasons. I personally attended my conference in last two weeks, which makes my two other teammates have a harder time. Also, there are some issues for Sawyer, and most of time, there will be a "time-out" bug so that robot will lose connection. We have to restarted the desktop. We contacted GSI but it seems no reasons was found. But even though, we almost finish it, just want 2-3 more hours! We have three slip days left. Although it is only allowed that 2 slip days can be applied for each project, can we still possibly make a special request for our case? 

Best

I was wondering if our group could possibly have an option for an extension on project 4, we haven't used any of our slip days yet so maybe could use some of the other 3 for it? We've been stuck on getting the simulation to work on getting the 4x4 pose custom_grasp_planner returns. We've tried using look_at_general (problem is that it's built for 1x3 matricies), get_gripper_pose (for some reason have a shape error) and making our own rotation and transform matrix which is inconsistent at returning valid poses.

Hello,

One of the consistent errors we're getting for our project is: 

raise error.SolverError(
cvxpy.error.SolverError: Solver 'ECOS' failed. Try another solver, or solve with verbose=True for more information.


I was wondering how to solve this bug? It comes up after the first 5 images of pawn/nozzle shows up. The code that is giving the error is:

prb = cvx.Problem(cvx.Minimize(cvx.norm(G @ f - desired_wrench, 2)), constraints)
prb.solve()

Now that we don't have a midterm and the grade breakdown percentages have been rearranged to account for that, I'm a little worried about surprise/unexpected grade changes.

Currently, we (at least I) only have grades for HW 1 and Project 1. I'm a little worried that all the remaining HW/project grades will come out all at once and my grade will suddenly change. When can we expect these grades to be released?

On a side note, I do believe holding back our grades since Jan 24 (when Project 1 was graded) is a little unfair as I have no idea how well I'm doing in the class and will have no chance to work to change my grade at this rate. I'm curious what other students think.

My final project group came up with a few different project ideas but each one of them brings a few questions about hardware:

Idea 1: Modifying DexNet, testing on Sawyer: We are concerned the Sawyer will not be able to run our model. Is it possible to run the model on a separate computer and send the results to the Sawyer to execute? Are there any instructions on how to do this?

Idea 2: Grasping with multiple turtlebots: Are we allowed to use multiple turtlebots? Is it possible to control multiple turtlebots from a single script?

Idea 3: RC car with shifting mass to take tighter corners: Do we have any hardware or a hardware budget for constructing a small, fast, wheeled robot?

Hi, what would constitute partial credit for question 3? I feel that my work deserves more than 0 points (which would be the same if someone had left the question entirely blank). I didn't calculate it for a frictionless point contact, but for a general wrench basis, oops, but I still feel like I should get some credit.

Hi, i’m stuck on the deadlock for project 5 because it seems that the robot always turns around instead of returning to it’s original trajectories for some reason and we just hoping to get if this is a tuning issue or not. 

For the 1st image is k1: 4.75 and k2:11.5
For the 2nd image k1:4.55 and k2:0.55

Try a k1 and k2 of 4, 4 -- if that doesn't work there may be a small bug with your implementation and I'm happy to take a closer look

After my turtlebot stops, it goes to the other direction then after a while starts coming back again. Is this normal? Also the velocity between the two directions are different (one is way slower than the other)

Hello,

I thought the video was to be pushed to our GitHub classroom repository, and only just now noticed there was a Gradescope submission (which is closed). Is it okay if we pay an extra slip day including the 2 free ones to submit our video?

Since it's my fault, and not my partner's, I'd like it if both slip days came from my allocated ones.

Thank you for your consideration.

we fixed our issue by reshaping aD, but now our controller does not work at all how it does in sim, also we noticed our aD is always 0, is that normal?:
 #get the trajectory states

 xD, vD, aD = self.trajectory.get_state(t)

 aD = aD.reshape(2,)

Hi,

I just wanted to confirm that i will receive credit for proj 5. My team and I finished proj 5 on time and submitted but the gradescope submission only let my teammate put an extra teammate on the gradescope submission so on my gradescope it says i never submitted proj 5. My  name is the doc and everything. I was told by them that i was ok but i just making sure and double checking with course staff. 

Thank you.
